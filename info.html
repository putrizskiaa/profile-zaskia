<h2>Project Journey</h2>
<p>Most of the projects I created are built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In my second semester, I’ve learned so many things especially considering my background as a social science (IPS) high school graduate. I realized that I have a lot to catch up on, but I never gave up. I push myself to improve at least 5% every day. I’m committed to deepening my design skills, particularly in UI/UX, and also expanding my knowledge in databases.
Some of the projects I’ve built include Goguma Calculator, Notes Calendar, Pixel To-Do, and Fairytale Scrapbook. Every project I create is something I truly design and understand—from the structure, functionality, to the final touches.</p>
